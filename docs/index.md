## <strong>Overview</strong>

This package expands the capabilities of the **EPIC crop simulation model**, to simulate crop growth and development across large geographies, such as entire states or counties by leveraging openly availabe remote sensing products and geospatial databases. Additionally, the toolkit features a unique calibration module that allows fine-tuning of model parameters to reflect specific local conditions or experimental results. This toolkit allows researchers to assess crop production potential, management scenarios and risks at broader scales, informing decision-making for sustainable agricultural practices.
