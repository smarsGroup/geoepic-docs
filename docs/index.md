### <strong>Overview</strong>

This package expands the capabilities of the **EPIC crop simulation model**, to simulate crop growth and development across large geographies, such as entire states or counties by leveraging openly availabe remote sensing products and geospatial databases. Additionally, the toolkit features a unique calibration module that allows fine-tuning of model parameters to reflect specific local conditions or experimental results. This toolkit allows researchers to assess crop production potential, management scenarios and risks at broader scales, informing decision-making for sustainable agricultural practices.


<!-- 
### <strong>Getting Started</strong>

To begin using GeoEPIC:

1. **Installation**: Follow the [installation guide](installation.md) to set up the toolkit in your Python environment.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your geospatial datasets, including soil, weather, and crop management data.
3. **Running Simulations**: Use the provided modules to set up and execute your EPIC model simulations.
4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze simulation outputs with built-in tools or export data for external analysis.

For detailed instructions, visit the [Getting Started](index.md) section. -->

<!-- ### <strong>Applications and Integrations</strong> -->
<!-- 
GeoEPIC has been adopted in various research projects and integrated into several tools: -->
